    description: [
      `Hello! My name is Chun-Mao, Lai, and I am a under-graduate student in Electrical Engineering Department in National Taiwan University since 2020. I've started learning programming since I graduated from high school, and I've tried different kinds of programming language and several applications by myself. Although I am a EE student, I have more passion in Computer Science.`,
      `I joined the Students' Association Information Department(SAID) and learning web development in my freshman year, and participant in several projects in my second year. Eventually, I become minister of SAID and lead the department to build several useful websites.`,
      `Except from Web Development, I also participant in several research in different domains, including Natural Language Programming, Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision.`,
      `During these years of learning, I've been coding in Javascript, Typescript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, MySQL, Tailwind, C, C++, C#, Verilog, Matlab, tensorflow programming language etc to name a few. I would like to learn more technique and build something big and interesting!`,
